# Chapter 2: Operators and Conditional Statements

## Overview

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of **Operators** and **Conditional Statements** in programming. These are essential building blocks that allow developers to manipulate data and control the flow of a program.

### Key Topics:
1. **Operators**:
    - Arithmetic Operators
    - Relational Operators
    - Logical Operators
    - Assignment Operators
    - Bitwise Operators
2. **Conditional Statements**:
    - `if` Statement
    - `else` Statement
    - `else if` Statement
    - `switch` Statement

## Operators

Operators are symbols that tell the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the different types:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators:
Used for basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example:
```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3;  // Addition
let product = 5 * 3;  // Multiplication
